# Google Summer of Code 2023
List of project ideas for contributors applying to the Google Summer of Code program in 2023.

## Timeline/milestones

Please always refer to the [official timeline](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/timeline). 
  
  
## Application Process

#### 0. Get familiar with GSoC

First of all, and if you have not done that yet, read [the contributor guide](https://google.github.io/gsocguides/student/) which will allow you to understand all this process and how the program works overall. Refer to its left side menu to quick access sections that may interest you the most, although we recommend you to read everything.  
  
#### 1. Discuss the project idea with the mentor(s)

This is a required step unless you have dived in into the existing codebase and understood everything perfectly (very hard) and the idea you prefer is on the list below.

If your idea is not listed, please discuss it with the mentors in the [IntelOwl Slack Channel](https://gsoc-slack.honeynet.org/). We're always open to new ideas and won't hesitate on choosing them if you demonstrate to be a good candidate!  
  
#### 2. Understand that

- You're committing to a project and we ask you to publicly publish your weekly progress on it in Github.
- We will ask you to give feedback on our mentorship and management continuously. Communication is key to the success of the project.
- You wholeheartedly agree with the [code of conduct](https://github.com/intelowlproject/IntelOwl/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
- You must tell us if there's any proposed idea that you don't think would fit the timeline or could be boring (yes, we're asking for feedback).
  
#### 3. Fill out the application form

We recommend you to follow [Google's guide to Writing a Proposal](https://google.github.io/gsocguides/student/writing-a-proposal) and to leverage the template we provide [here](https://github.com/intelowlproject/gsoc/blob/main/proposal_template.md)

Once you have a draft proposal please share it with us in Google Docs. In this way we don't have to download anything and we can comment it and request clarifications in a more structured way.

You can also ask for a review anytime to the community or mentor candidates before the contributor application deadline. It's much easier if you get feedback early than to wait for the last moment.
