Since 2023 we are proposing IntelOwl and [GreedyBear](https://github.com/honeynet/GreedyBear) to the GSoC under a new non-profit organization called [IntelOwl Project](https://www.linkedin.com/company/intelowl) (if it gets accepted by Google) and not anymore under the Honeynet Project. Nothing would change for an aspiring new contributor.

Starting from 2023, you may find the updated project ideas list for the current year in the dedicated folder.
